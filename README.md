Created in 2021

Built with Python and PyGame
This was a reprogram of a project originally created in 2020.
This project was a solo developed rpg style game that used assests created by my brother. 
As the main character, you can use SPACE to shoot enemies and WASD/Arrows to move around the map.
There are 4 different areas that you can go through, and click S or Down at the end/start of each map will teleport you.
You can also pick up items that enemies drop once killed.
